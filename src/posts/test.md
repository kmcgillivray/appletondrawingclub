# 2024 Appleton Drawing Club Recap

It’s almost the end of the first year of Appleton Drawing Club! Since our first session back in April, it’s been a highlight of the year to meet so many artists and art models, and to enjoy drawing together.

I started regularly attending life drawing sessions in April of 2022. I immediately fell in love with the life drawing atmosphere—the challenge of drawing from life, the camaraderie with fellow artists, and the collaboration with art models. Since then I was excited to gradually discover a wide range of life drawing opportunities in Wisconsin all the way from northern Door County to Milwaukee (ex. The fantastic GB Life Drawing for long pose portraits, long pose figure drawing at the Richeson Gallery, cozy sessions at the Miller Art Museum and Artists’ Guild in Sturgeon Bay, and the weekly sessions at Var Gallery in Milwaukee).

I wanted to contribute to the range of life drawing available to local artists and saw a need for an evening session of mixed pose figure drawing in Appleton. I hoped to make the sessions useful to experienced artists and especially welcoming to beginners who might catch a strong interest in life drawing.

The main challenges when starting a new life drawing group are finding a suitable venue and spreading the word to both artists and models. For the venue, I’m endlessly grateful to the folks at the Photo Opp who have shared their studio space with us—it’s not only a suitable venue, it’s an ideal space for life drawing including access to photography lighting. The Photo Opp crew has also generously shared their time assisting with setup and promotion for sessions. It’s been a pleasure working with the Photo Opp and I recommend checking out their wide range of photography events if you haven’t!

So far, connecting with art models hasn’t been a major challenge, especially thanks to artist Ally Wilbur who kindly introduced many new models to the group over the year. It’s been awesome to work with so many first time art models, and I’ve been so grateful for each model’s thoughtful poses and professionalism.

It’s been particularly exciting to meet so many local artists, some who have done life drawing before but didn’t have an opportunity for a while, and many who are completely new to life drawing. Each session has had a mix of new artists and regular attendees, and we end each one with a “drawing pile” to share our work with each other.

The goal for next year is to keep a regular monthly figure drawing session going, aiming for the second Wednesday of each month. I also hope to schedule a second monthly event with a variety of formats, such as a “pub scrawl”, sketch walks, portrait sessions, and perhaps even wildlife drawing featuring falcons! There’s also been steady interest in tutored sessions with drawing lessons focused on life drawing. If you have any requests or ideas for new sessions, let us know!

Our last session of the year is Dec. 11 7-9PM at the Photo Opp and tickets are available here. I hope you can join us! Also, follow Appleton Drawing Club on Instagram, or sign up for the newsletter to be notified of the new year session schedule.
