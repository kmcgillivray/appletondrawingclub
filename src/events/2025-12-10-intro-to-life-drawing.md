Curious about getting started with life drawing but not sure what to expect? Been to a few sessions but looking for more support and guidance? Join us for this introductory life drawing workshop!

In this workshop, you'll experience a classic figure drawing session with supportive guidance and instructive practice exercises provided by instructor and artist Kevin McGillivray. We'll cover the basics of life drawing and how to attend a life drawing session, and then explore a series of essential exercises while drawing from an unclothed model. Kevin will be on hand to provide instruction, encouragement, and feedback throughout the session.

This session is great for complete beginners and for anyone looking for direct support and feedback to improve their figure drawing skills.

## What to bring

Bring any of your favorite drawing materials – even a simple notebook and pencil is enough to get started. We'll have a few basic materials available as backup.
