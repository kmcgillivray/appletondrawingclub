This workshop is a deep dive into the most elusive and mysterious element of figure drawing: gesture! Through a series of exercises and a guided figure drawing session, you'll explore the gestural energy that gives life and movement to all figure drawings. We'll start with a series of exercises designed to define gesture and practice seeing and drawing gesturally, followed by a guided drawing session with an unclothed model. During the session we'll continue to practice gestural exercises with direct feedback and encouragement. By the end of the workshop, you'll have the knowledge and exercises needed to develop confidence and fluency in gesture drawing in your figure drawing practice from short poses to long studies.

I'm Kevin McGillivray, I'm a visual artist based in Appleton, working primarily in charcoal drawing and oil painting. My work explores themes of mythic perception, wholeness, and the <em>Quality Without a Name</em>. I've been practicing in drawing and oil painting since 2012 with a focus on expressive mark-making and direct observation, and I'm the host and organizer of Appleton Drawing Club.

In my classes, I aim to create a welcoming, encouraging space for artists of all levels, whether you're new to life drawing, actively practicing, or returning after some time away. I focus on exercises for your hands, eyes, mind, and heart to develop fluency in foundational drawing skills as well as your own artistic vision and creative practice. I hope you will join us, and I look forward to drawing with you!

## What to bring

Bring any of your favorite drawing materials – even a simple notebook and pencil is enough to get started. We'll have a few basic materials available as backup.
