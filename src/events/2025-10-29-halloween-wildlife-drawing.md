Welcome to a very special Halloween **WILDLIFE drawing session** with Appleton Drawing Club! Draw live from a menagerie of incredible corvids and owls. These majestic **avian ambassadors** will be visiting us from [Raptor Education Group (REGI)](https://www.raptoreducationgroup.org). You'll have an up close encounter with these remarkable birds, with plenty of time to draw from direct observation and learn about them with the help of the REGI educators. Just in time for Halloween, make new friends with corvids and owls!

# About Raptor Education Group

**All proceeds for this event will be donated to Raptor Education Group, Inc.** REGI is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to the care and rehabilitation of injured or orphaned native bird species and public education of wildlife issues. Founded in 1990 by Marge Gibson and her late husband, Don, REGI was initially focused on educational programming and field research on avian species, but quickly grew to address the need for a rehabilitation center in the area, especially for raptors and swans. Today, REGI takes in anywhere from 800 to over 1,000 patients each year and provides educational programs to hundreds of people.

# About the Avian Ambassadors

REGI educators will be bringing owls and corvids from their team of **Avian Ambassadors** – working birds who help REGI to educate the public about wildlife issues. These birds are permanent residents who are unable to be released into the wild. Some of the ambassadors you might meet are:

- DAZZLING CORVID Rosie the American Crow
- JAUNTY NOCTURNES Jasper and Lucy the Eastern Screech-Owls
- HAUNTING HOST Aldo the Barred Owl

If we're lucky, we might even meet:

- SPIRITED TRICKSTER Eclipse the Raven

And maybe even a special guest:

- LOCAL LEGEND Kyle the Hawk (with licensed falconer Brandi Grahl)
