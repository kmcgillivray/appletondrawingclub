summary: Join in for a holiday portrait club where we all draw each other!
---

You're invited to join us at **Commodore Club** for a fun and _free_ casual drawing club hangout where we draw each other's portraits! Everyone will have a chance to take turns posing for short 10 minute portraits in small groups while drawing and hanging out with their friends, neighbors, and fellow artists. This is our Appleton Drawing Club holiday party, so festive attire is encouraged for merry, merry portraits!

This event is free to attend, although we encourage you to order at least one drink at the bar (non-alcoholic options available!) as a thank you to our generous hosts at Commodore Club.

## Holiday art supply swap

If you’d like to participate in the **holiday art supply swap**, wrap up some unused art supplies from your stock at home and bring them along (value $20 or less). We’ll exchange gifts randomly and you’ll take home some new art supplies to try!

## Agenda

- Pre-session: Meet at Commodore Club and settle in! Portraits start at 7:00 but feel free to arrive early for socializing and good cheer
- Join a small group of 4-5 artists to take turns posing for 10 minute portraits
- We'll take a short break half way through and then find a new group of artists
- Hang out after the portraits for more social time and merriment!
