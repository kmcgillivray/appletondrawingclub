  <h2>About the class</h2>
  
  <p>Explore the expressive world of charcoal in this beginner-friendly class! This 3-hour session introduces fundamental drawing skills such as mark-making, modeling form, and sketching with gesture and structure, helping students develop confidence and fluency in their drawing. Through guided exercises and demonstrations, participants will learn how to create depth, atmosphere, and lively compositions using the unique properties of charcoal.</p>
  <p>By the end of the class, students will leave with practical exercises they can continue at home to further develop their skills. Whether you're picking up charcoal for the first time or refining your technique, this class offers a supportive space to explore its expressive potential.</p>

  <p>I'm Kevin McGillivray, I'm a visual artist based in Wisconsin, working primarily in charcoal drawing and oil painting. My work explores themes of mythic perception, wholeness, and the <em>Quality Without a Name</em>. I've been practicing in drawing and oil painting since 2012 with a focus on expressive mark-making and direct observation, and I'm the host and organizer of <a href="https://appletondrawingclub.com">Appleton Drawing Club</a>.</p>

  <p>In my classes, I aim to create a welcoming, encouraging space for artists of all levels, whether you're new to charcoal or returning to drawing after some time away. I focus on exercises for your hands, eyes, mind, and heart to develop fluency in foundational drawing skills as well as your own artistic vision and creative practice. I hope you will join us, and I look forward to drawing with you!</p>
