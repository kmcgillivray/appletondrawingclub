<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

<h2>What is life drawing?</h2>

<p>
  Life drawing is the practice of drawing or painting from a live model. Life drawing takes many forms, from quick gesture drawings to longer poses, and exercises a wide range of art skills and techniques. Life drawing is often practiced with an unclothed model, but sessions also feature clothed models, portrait models, animals, and other subjects.

<h2>Do I need to become a member to attend an Appleton Drawing Club session?</h2>

<p>
  If you attend a session, you are a member! No need to sign up or do anything special to join. Just join us and draw!
</p>

<h2>Do I need experience to attend?</h2>

<p>
  Not at all! We welcome people of all skill levels and backgrounds. Whether you're a seasoned pro or have never drawn before, you're welcome to join us. If a workshop or session is geared toward a specific skill level, we'll make sure to note that in the event description.

<h2>What should I bring to a session?</h2>

<p>
  Bring any of your preferred art supplies. This could be a sketchbook and pencils, charcoal, pastels, or whatever you like to use. If you're new to drawing, a simple sketchbook and a few pencils are a great place to start. We often have basic drawing paper and pencils available at the session if you need some, but it's a good idea to bring your own. Soon we also hope to provide plenty of large easels, but for now we recommend bringing you bring your own easel or drawing board.

<h2>Can I use other media like oil, watercolors, or digital tools?</h2>

<p>
  Yes! As long as your setup doesn’t disrupt others, you’re free to use the medium of your choice. Just be sure to clean up any mess from your supplies and respect the space.
</p>

<h2>Is there an instructor?</h2>

<p>
  Our regular sessions are uninstructed but we plan to offer workshops and classes in the future. Artists frequently help each other and share tips and techniques during the session.
