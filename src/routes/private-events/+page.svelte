  <h1 class="text-5xl text-center mb-4">Book a private event</h1>
  <p>We are available to run a life drawing session for your group as a private event, including tattoo artists and apprentices, corporate events, parties, and more! If you are interested in booking a private event, please fill out the form below and we'll be in touch to work out the details.</p>
  <p>We will provide a model, a session leader, and drawing supplies (if requested), and will host the session either in your own space or offsite in a space we book for you. We can tailor the session to your specific needs depending on the experience level of the participants and type of event. For example, we can provide direct instruction and guidance, light suggestions for beginners, or no instruction at all, and we can plan special themes specific to your group and depending on your budget.</p>
  <p>A standard session starts at $20 per participant for a two hour session, and varies depending on level of instruction, venue, and supplies provided.</p>
  <p>If you have any questions about private events, please <a href="/contact">contact us</a>. We look forward to drawing with you!</p>
