  <p>
    I'm Kevin McGillivray, I'm a visual artist based in Wisconsin, working
    primarily in charcoal drawing and oil painting. My work explores themes of
    mythic perception, wholeness, and the <em>Quality Without a Name</em>. I've
    been practicing in drawing and oil painting since 2012 with a focus on
    expressive mark-making and direct observation, and I'm the host and
    organizer of
    <a href="https://appletondrawingclub.com">Appleton Drawing Club</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my classes, I aim to create a welcoming, encouraging space for artists of
    all levels, whether you're new to charcoal or returning to drawing after
    some time away. I focus on exercises for your hands, eyes, mind, and heart
    to develop fluency in foundational drawing skills as well as your own
    artistic vision and creative practice. I hope you will join us, and I look
    forward to drawing with you!
