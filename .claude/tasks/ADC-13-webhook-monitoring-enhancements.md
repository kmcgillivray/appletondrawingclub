# ADC-13: Webhook Monitoring and Advanced Reliability Enhancements

**Status**: Future Enhancement  
**Prerequisites**: ADC-12 (Webhook Reliability) must be completed  
**Complexity**: Medium to High  

## Overview

Advanced webhook monitoring and reliability features to enhance operational visibility and provide bulletproof reliability beyond the core pending registration flow implemented in ADC-12.

## Current State (Post ADC-12)

âœ… **Core Reliability Solved**:
- Pending registration flow prevents data loss
- Basic idempotency protection prevents duplicates  
- Proper error handling triggers Stripe retries
- Zero registration data loss from webhook failures

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### 1. Enhanced Event Status Tracking

**Goal**: Comprehensive audit trail and monitoring for all webhook events

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- New webhook_events table
CREATE TABLE webhook_events (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  stripe_event_id TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  event_type TEXT NOT NULL,
  processing_status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending',
  payload JSONB NOT NULL,
  error_message TEXT,
  attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  processed_at TIMESTAMP,
  processing_duration_ms INTEGER
);

CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_events_status ON webhook_events (processing_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_webhook_events_created ON webhook_events (created_at);
```

**Benefits**:
- Full audit trail of all webhook processing
- Detailed error context for debugging
- Processing performance metrics
- Retry pattern analysis

**When Valuable**: When webhook volume increases or complex debugging is needed

---

### 2. Reconciliation System

**Goal**: Catch and fix rare cases where webhooks are completely missed

**Implementation**:
- Daily cron job comparing Stripe checkout sessions with local registrations
- Configurable lookback period (default: 7 days)
- Automatic fixing of obvious mismatches
- Alert system for manual review cases

**Components**:
```typescript
// Reconciliation service
interface ReconciliationReport {
  stripe_payments_found: number;
  local_registrations_found: number;
  mismatches_detected: number;
  auto_fixed_count: number;
  manual_review_needed: number;
}

// Edge Functions
- supabase/functions/reconcile-payments/index.ts
- supabase/functions/generate-reconciliation-report/index.ts
```

**Benefits**:
- Safety net for extremely rare webhook delivery failures
- Data integrity verification
- Peace of mind for critical payment processing

**When Valuable**: As payment volume grows or for high-stakes events

---

### 3. Admin Dashboard for Webhook Monitoring

**Goal**: Simple operational visibility into webhook health

**Features**:
- Recent webhook events (last 24h/7d)
- Processing status breakdown (success/failed/pending)
- Error rate trending
- Registration completion funnel metrics
- Failed event retry status

**Implementation Options**:
- Simple SvelteKit admin page (`/admin/webhooks`)
- Read-only dashboard consuming webhook_events table
- Basic charts for event volume and success rates

**Benefits**:
- Quick health check capabilities
- Early warning system for processing issues
- Data-driven troubleshooting

**When Valuable**: When you need operational monitoring or have multiple administrators

---

### 4. Automated Cleanup Jobs

**Goal**: Prevent database bloat and maintain system health

**Components**:

**Stale Registration Cleanup**:
```sql
-- Remove pending registrations older than configurable threshold
DELETE FROM registrations 
WHERE processing_status = 'pending' 
  AND created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days';
```

**Webhook Event Archival**:
```sql
-- Archive old webhook events to separate table or delete
DELETE FROM webhook_events 
WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days'
  AND processing_status = 'completed';
```

**Health Reporting**:
- Weekly summary emails
- Database size monitoring
- Processing performance trends

**Benefits**:
- Prevents unbounded database growth
- Maintains optimal query performance
- Regular health insights

**When Valuable**: After system has been running for several months

---

### 5. Advanced Error Handling and Monitoring

**Goal**: Sophisticated error analysis and alerting

**Features**:
- Error categorization (network, validation, database, etc.)
- Failure pattern detection
- Custom retry logic for different error types
- Integration with monitoring services (optional)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface ErrorContext {
  error_category: 'network' | 'validation' | 'database' | 'stripe' | 'unknown';
  error_details: Record<string, any>;
  recovery_action?: string;
  alert_level: 'info' | 'warning' | 'critical';
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Faster problem diagnosis
- Proactive issue detection
- Intelligent retry strategies

**When Valuable**: For mission-critical payment processing or high webhook volumes

---

## Implementation Priority

**Phase 1: Monitoring Foundation**
- Enhanced event status tracking
- Basic cleanup jobs
- **Effort**: 1-2 days

**Phase 2: Operational Tools**  
- Admin dashboard
- Reconciliation system
- **Effort**: 3-5 days

**Phase 3: Advanced Features**
- Sophisticated error handling
- Performance monitoring
- **Effort**: 2-3 days

## Decision Framework

**Implement These When**:
- Webhook volume > 100/day
- Multiple people managing the system
- Payment processing becomes business-critical
- Debugging webhook issues becomes time-consuming
- Compliance requires audit trails

**Current Status**: Core reliability is sufficient for most use cases

## Files That Would Be Modified

- **New**: `supabase/migrations/xxx_webhook_events_table.sql`
- **New**: `supabase/functions/reconcile-payments/index.ts`
- **New**: `supabase/functions/cleanup-stale-registrations/index.ts`
- **New**: `src/routes/admin/webhooks/+page.svelte`
- **Modify**: `supabase/functions/stripe-webhook/index.ts` (add event logging)

## Success Metrics

- Zero undetected webhook failures
- < 1 minute mean time to detect processing issues  
- Automated resolution of 90%+ reconciliation discrepancies
- Clear operational visibility into payment processing health

**Note**: These enhancements build upon the solid reliability foundation from ADC-12. The core problem (webhook failure data loss) is already solved. These features add operational excellence and monitoring capabilities.
